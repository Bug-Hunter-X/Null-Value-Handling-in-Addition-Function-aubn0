# JavaScript Bug: Null Value Handling in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common bug in JavaScript related to handling null values in arithmetic operations.  The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers but has unexpected behavior when one or both inputs are null.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function does not explicitly handle cases where one or both of the input arguments (`a` and `b`) are null. This results in unexpected behavior and potential errors (like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'valueOf')` in strict mode).

## Solution
The issue is addressed in `bugSolution.js` by adding a check for null values at the beginning of the function. If either `a` or `b` is null, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds with the normal addition.

This example highlights the importance of handling null values appropriately in JavaScript functions to prevent unexpected errors and ensure robust code.
